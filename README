********** Section 3 **********  (explain each completed component)
createTweet.c: prompts user to enter a username, than a tweet, it than uses 
the ascii values from the username characters plus the length of the tweet
to generate a unique ID for the user, and stores it in the struct tweet

displayTweets.c: displays the prior tweets along with the username and ID

searchTweetsByKeyword.c: prompts the user to enter a keyword, it than searchs the 
tweet for sed keyword and displays the tweet containing it along with the users
name who wrote that tweet

countStopWords.c: simply displays the number of stop words that were discovered out of the many tweets searched.

deleteTweet.c: displays the # of tweets than prompts the user to choose one of those tweets to delete. Then removes that tweet from the list

saveTweetsToFile.c: prompts the user to enter a filename to save the tweet too
and than copies the tweets contents, the users name and their generated ID
onto sed file

loadTweetsFromFile.c prompts the user to enter a filename to load tweet from
and imports it into the struct

********** Section 4 **********  (limitations)
I could not complete the sortID function

********** Section 5 **********  (improvements)
In the future I am going to try to make my program cleaner and make the link list easier
to follow and understand. Also I would like to add more error checking mechanisms into my
functions. I need more time and practice to get better at that.
